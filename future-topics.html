        <h2>Mar 24th: Existentialism in Popular Culture [ENG]</h2>
        <p class="description">
            What is existentialism, in its scholastic definition? How is it interpreted and manifested differently in the secular culture? Is there a gap of understanding between the two interpretations? If so, how is this gap produced?
            <br> is existentialism secularized and expressed through creative works, such as novels, films, and TV shows? To what extent should we inherit scholastic existentialism to parse out these recreational, popular works? 
            <br> How is existentialism being globalized? What are cultural contexts that fostered the local propagation of existential thoughts? Are there any common worries that led to this globalization of existentialism? 
            <br> Why did people choose existentialism? Does it provide a unique way out to address current problems? Is this solution “effective”? How would the scholastic interpretation critique this secularized existentialism and its provided “solution”?</p>

        <h2>Apr: ChatGPT as Our Extended Mind?</h2>
        <p class="description">Can humans' minds be extended? Can we store and process information externally? Can AI facilitate our thinking by becoming a part of our minds?</p>
